Week 47 ADC (analog didigtal convertor)


# Where can you find specs for the ADC in the RP2040?
>> Chapter 4.9 https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf (microcontroller)

# Where can you find Python programming reference for the PICO micropython port ?
>> Chapter 3.3 https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf
SDK = means software development kit

# What is an analog signal ?
A signal between minum and maximum value with infinite values in between. It is a contant value that is from a device.
# What is a digital signal ?
>> Converts it into 0-1 (binary) and it can be readed by the ADC converting from the analog signal(from the device).

# What is bit depth ?
>> It is the resolution of the converted signal,

# What is sample rate ?
The rate of which the analog signal is converted into the digital signal (how many times we read the signal). how often we take sample
# What type of ADC does the RP2040 use ?
>> Sar ADC
# What is the bit depth of the RP2040 ADC ?
>> 12 bit

# What bit depth is used in micropython ?

>>16 bit
# How many ADC channels does the RP2040 have ?
>> 4 channel

# How do you instantiate an ADC channel in micropython
>> Programmable IO (PIO) support, how many pins are used and if they are in/out pins.

# How do you read the RP2040 internal temperature sensor in micropython ?
