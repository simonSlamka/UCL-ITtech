Installing microPython was pretty simple. I was personally surprised by the simplicity of using
Pico. I used STM32 before (a lot) and it was quite complicated. I had to download a modified
version of the good old Eclipse and do complicated setup so it could work. The microPython setup
of the Pico was literally just moving a single file. I also worked with the "big" RPi a lot,
building simple robots and playing around. So yeah, that's me.
