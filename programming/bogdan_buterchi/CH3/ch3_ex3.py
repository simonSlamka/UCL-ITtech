Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and
1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is
between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:

Score Grade:
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
Enter score: 0.95
A
Enter score: perfect
Bad score
Enter score: 10.0
Bad score
Enter score: 0.75
C
Enter score: 0.5
F
Run the program repeatedly as shown above to test the various different values for
input.

try:
    score = float(input('Enter score: '))
    if score <=0:
        print('Bad score')
    elif score > 1:
        print('Bad score')
    elif score >= 0.9:
        print('A')
    elif score >= 0.8:
        print('B')
    elif score >= 0.7:
        print('C')
    elif score >= 0.6:
        print('D')
    elif score < 0.6:
        print('F')
