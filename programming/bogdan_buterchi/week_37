###Excersises from PY4E Ch2

###Exercise 1
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello " + name)

###Exercise 2
hours = int(input("Enter hours per week here: "))
rate = float(input("Enter your rate here: "))
payrate = str(hours * rate)
print("Your pay seems to be " + payrate)

###Exercise 3
width=17
height=12.0

print(width//2)  # =8, int
print(width/2.0) # =8.5, float
print(height/3)  # =4.0, int
print(1+2*5)     # =11, int

###Exercise 4
celcius = float(input("insert Celcius temperature here: "))
fahrent = str(celcius * 1.8 + 32)
print("Your Temperature in Fahrentheit is: " + fahrent)  # this will convert the value of celcius temp to fahrenheit


###Answers that maybe will come in useful
1. syntax errors are the ones where you forget to put the signs specific to the programming language like "()" and misspelling errors
   logical errors are when you write ererything correctly but inverse something by mistake
   semantic errors the code doesn't produce an error but it doesn't do the "right" thing that you want.
2. the input is when you write code
   the output is the result of that code writing.
3. sequential execution is the programe running our code in the order that you write it
4. 4 steps of debugging are reading running ruminating retreating

1. 3 types: string for a string of words, integers for numbers and floats for decimals
2. you need to write in the interpreter "type(add here the value)"
3. variables are the words that you define in a programe
4. reserved words are the ones that already have a command given to them and you can't assign a different command to them
5. a statement is code that the interpreter can execute
