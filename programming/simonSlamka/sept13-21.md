### Exercise 0
- Syntax errors are errors in the usage of a programming language's commands. Either they're mispelled or non-existent at all.
A missing semicolon is also a syntax error
- Input is the taking-in of (unprocessed) information into a system, while output is the taking-out of (processed) information out of a system (generalized)
- The ordered processing of statements as they're written. One statement executes after the immediately previous one
- At first, I personally write print-outs of certain values that I need to see what might be wrong.
If that doesn't work, I go over the code that I suspect is the problem and I think really hard about what the problem might be.
