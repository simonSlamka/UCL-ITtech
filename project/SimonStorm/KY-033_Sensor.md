The Arduino KY-033 line tracking sensor is exactly what is sounds like. It is also known as a hunt sensor. It uses IR to differentiate black and white color. It basically has both IR emitting and receiving diodes, and when the IR is not bounced back at the receiving diode it sends a 0 output signal. The sensor connection consists of three pins. One pin is **ground**, one is **VCC** and the third is **OUTPUT SIGNAL**. It sends out an ON/OFF signal.
