KY-011 TWO COLOR LED MODULE


KY-011 Description
3mm Two colour LED module KY-011 for Arduino, emits red and green light. You can adjust the amount of each colour using PWM. This module is similar to KY-029.

KY-011 Specifications
This module consists of a common cathode 3mm red/green LED and a 0? resistor, since operating voltage is 2.0v ~2.5v you'll need to use limiting resistors to prevent burnout when connecting to the Arduino.

KY-011 Connection Diagram
We'll use a couple of 330? resistors to limit the current from the Arduino and prevent burning the LED.
