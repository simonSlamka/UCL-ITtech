# Brainstorming

## Deep learning-controlled butler in real life robot serving drinks

### Requirements (_ordered by priority_)
#### Sensors
- IR sensors
- Ultrasound sensors
- Gyroscope (the multi-sensor board)
- Camera
- 3D mapping capabillity

#### Must have (Is there a workaround or an alternative?)
- Self-navigation capability
- The ability to learn from experience
- Discord control panel connectivity (a channel in the server)
    - Network connectivity
#### Should have
- Object recognizing
- Light emitters on board or maybe a like some kind of sound warning (like flashlights or LEDs letting people know that the bot is near them so they don't kill it with their feet :-D)
#### Could have
- Light sensor to control on-robot lights.
- Facial recognizing (_could be_ but likely unreachable within the scope of this project)
- Multi robot/Multi capacity for faster multi delivery
- Deep learning instead of example-based learning
#### Won't have
- Drink mixing capability

- We think MoSCoW and Kano go hand in hand. You could/should use both.
